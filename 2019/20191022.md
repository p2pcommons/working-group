-   [`@p2pcommons/specs`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs)
    -   Interoperability
        -   Now includes database schemas thanks to Diego
        -   [Needs description of what database, how to access, where located](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs/blob/master/interoperability.md#indexing-modules)
            → now still refers to `~/.p2pcommons/index.json`
            -   Could be \~/.p2pcommons/leveldb/?
        -   License needs to be further specified to CC0
        -   No license for profile
    -   Module
        -   `subtype` name/value pair added. The vision here is to work with WikiData qualifiers to identify what these are, so we might need to work on a `subtype` specification later on
        -   Explicitly made the regex such that it doesn’t allow multiple identifications separated by hyphens, to prevent these massive blobs [`\^\\w+\$`](https://regex101.com/r/hDRGfc/1)
        -   *Julian: Maybe mimetypes?*
-   [`@p2pcommons/sdk-js`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js)
    -   Update by Diego
        -   Last version incorporated with hypergraph
        -   Working on getting these issues fixe
            -   Writing out `~/.p2pcommons/dat.json` not functioning in `@hypergraph-xyz/cli`
            -   Writing out `~/.p2pcommons/.dat` not functioning in `@hypergraph-xyz/cli`
                -   Hyperdrive v10 changes this?
                -   `~/.p2pcommons/&lt;hash&gt;/&lt;\\d{2}&gt;/&lt;\\d{2}&gt;`
                -   This information in a different place?
            -   Database and `~/.p2pcommons` not in sync
        -   For example, create four modules, remove whole of `~/.p2pcommons/` after the first two, but “List writable modules” still displays four hashes
        -   I had this put for `v0.4.0`, but it is a bigger hassle than I
             imagined so wanted to ask whether we could prioritize it?
             Best to deal with this in the SDK I think
    -   Are we planning to have validators in the sdk for the module
        specs beyond the schemas? Do we need them?
        -   Schema is good for some things
        -   Might need some validation for e.g., license
-   [`@hypergraph-xyz/cli`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/cli)
    -   Update by Julian
        -   More test coverage
        -   Latest sdk
        -   Change env still same data → that needs to be fixed in sdk
        -   Prompt user when new module
        -   Q1 how to distribute the cli?
            -   Basic npm module or one-step installer?
            -   Outdated version warning
            -   One step installer :)
        -   Q2 editing experience?
            -   Open in browser through localhost
            -   Clientside only
            -   Embedding html becomes more difficult
                -   Only local embeds
            -   Everything with everything, but not perfect
    -   Create profile -&gt; Display title → name? (to prevent
         confusion)
    -   Read metadata -&gt; have a prompt to select based on title?
    -   Update metadata -&gt; have a prompt to select based on title for
         writables?
        -   Old title dark grey, not readable on dark terminal
        -   Capitalize names for consistency (now reads `title` not
            `Title` as in create)
    -   List writable modules -&gt; Show the titles?
    -   Show module folder?
    -   Select main file for module?
-   [`@hypergraph-xyz/desktop`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/desktop)
    -   Production pipeline setup?
    -   Designer
        -   Got several applications, some promising candidates but all
             remote outside Germany. Organizational knowledge too slim
             right now to also do remote in-house workers outside of
             Germany... :(
        -   I started researching what applications are useful for
             designing
        -   Windows + Mac store lateerrrr; too much of a hassle now
-   `@hypergraph-xyz/mobile`
    -   Anyone with experience on mobile development pipelines?
        -   React native? → Experimental tech
        -   How to get Dat on there?
        -   E.g., how to get something into a play store?
        -   Get a designer with experience to submit to iOS and Android
             store
            -   Apple Human design guidelines
        -   P2p on mobile doesn’t really work? Could just do normal
             client-server relation
        -   Notifications require server
