-   General announcements
    - Roadmaps for each project are/will be in the GitHub wiki. We will discuss those over time anyway, but then you know where to find them if you need them.
    - Hypergraph Registry --> Hypergraph Vault
-   [`@p2pcommons/specs`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs)
    - Update by Chris
      - Keep the text spec open over the next weeks, because slow and steady improvements are best right now
      - Added an HTTPS recommendation
      - Next up? Dogfooding interoperability spec
        - JG: Not that urgent. We can eventually add code to the spec?
        - CHJH: We can always give a bit of money for alternative p2pcommons applications to proxy dogfood it
    - Questions
-   [`@p2pcommons/sdk-js`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js)
    - Update by Diego 
      - Continued working on the networking part of `sdk-js`
      - Worked on realistic scenario for reproducing content
        - Got a connection to swarm and debugged further
        - Small scenario of the problem
          - Seed archive and download from other place using corestore-swarm
          - mirror-folder worked, couldn't find problem
          - switched to hyperswarm
          - made some changes to have only one swarm for multiple hyperdrives, created this manually
        - went on a new debugging session, showed that there was a primary problem with versions
          - `corestore-swarm-networing` was using the latest version (v7+) of `hypercore-protocol` which isn't same that hyperdrive (v10+) is using (v6+).  
          - manual install of `hypercore-protocol` v6 fixed it
        - basic swarm working on `sdk-js` :confetti_ball: merged into master now
        - aware of issues that were the result of the dogfooding of hypergraph-xyz/cli implementation of registration
          - implementing new checks for [versioned key](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/issues/48)
          - CHJH: If registering without version --> we can assume latest version to be added to URL
          - looking at the other issues of dogfooding too
            - [exponential increase in content keys of same module](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/issues/50)
            - [prefix of `dat://` issue](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/issues/49)
    - Questions
      - DP: Maybe we can bring back the `dat-doctor` at some point?
        - JG: Maybe we can use a proxy at some point as fallback
        - CHJH: That might be a function for Hypergraph Vault
      - CHJH: How does this affect checkout things?
        - DP: we are checking out specific versions, but not seeding (yet)
      - CHJH: Maybe a worthwhile thing to do a short documentation of this debugging journey?
        - DP: Might be worthwhile yes :+1:
      - CHJH: Final question, is this backward compatible with older hyperdrives? (e.g., what Dat is still using today)
        - DP: Don't think so, but not tested.
      - DP: General comment --> if you want examples for `sdk-js` you can check [`p2pcommons/sdk-js/example.js`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/blob/master/example.js) or [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/dpaez/f85feaddf9533228c033abbe50ef61ac)
-   [`@hypergraph-xyz/cli`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/cli)
    - Update by Julian
      - Decided to remove the read action, because it was returning JSON. But now we decided to re-add it in a tabular format.
      - Adding the `register` action
        - Open PR right now
      - Adding the editor
        - Open PR now too :)
        - integrated editor to edit main file if main file is html (otherwise it creates it)
        - very basic implementation right now
    - Questions
-   [`@hypergraph-xyz/editor`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/editor)
    - Update by Julian
      - Editor has three modes
        1. Developer mode
        2. CLI mode
        3. Library mode --> this is how it's integrated in @hypergraph-xyz/cli
      - Implemented full RTF editor based on Editoria, for basic WYSIWYG experience
      - Rough spots:
        - only updated about content updates every 1s (easy to lose content)
          - working with Wax team on this
    - Questions
      - CHJH: Do we want to partner?
        - JG: Let's take a bit more time, consider the features we need and balance our decision. Other examples include [Slate](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate). We can only see the full potential once we start customising in essence.
-   [`@hypergraph-xyz/desktop`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/desktop)
    - Update by Julian
    - Questions
-   `@hypergraph-xyz/mobile`
    - PLACEHOLDER
-   `@hypergraph-xyz/vault`
    - Update by Chris
      - This was renamed from registry --> vault (as per general announcements)
- Roundabout
  - CHJH: [Neha Moopen](https://twitter.com/NehaMoopen) joined the team as a researcher; will be helping with developing testing frameworks for major, minor, and patch releases. Will also be helping us figure out how we we want to do out support ticketing (e.g., Zammad).
