    - Update by Diego
        - Released `v0.3.2` last week, today `v0.3.3`
        - Networking works :confetti_ball:
        - Last week new hyperdrive release. It was a patch version but included breaking changes.
        - Today's update includes a specific version of [`@geut/hyperdrive-promise`](https://github.com/geut/hyperdrive-promise) *1.0.2* which is using a fixed version of hyperdrive (*10.3.2*)
        - Preparing for upgrade to new hyperdrive
        - If there is an urgent task (e.g., from dogfooding :hotdog:) can focus on that
        - [New corestore](https://github.com/andrewosh/corestore-swarm-networking) can also centralise the stores we now have in each Dat archive separately
            - May help improve performance and simplify codebase
            - Allows for namespaces too
            - Would move the `.dat/`
    - Questions
-   [`@hypergraph-xyz/cli`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/cli)
    - Update by Julian
        - Improved UX by adding spinners when waiting (to show it's not stalling)
            - Once we have the daemon, we can exit immediately
        - CLI updated to `sdk-js@v0.3.3` (allowed small refactor)
        - Register PR coming up
            - It works now, gets version in contents
            - Ready to test
            - Still an inconsistency in usage of `dat://` prefix.
        - Changed create action --> currently require profile to create content, now if you don't you just get prompted for profile information
    - Questions
-   [`@hypergraph-xyz/desktop`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/desktop)
    - Update by Julian
        - Setup work continued, started including `react` powered by `babel` and `webpack` for pipeline
        - Step higher in abstraction from electron to react now

-   [`@hypergraph-xyz/vault`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/vault)
    - Update by Chris
        - Made an overview of the architecture at a high level for reference (see [Vault wiki](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/vault/wiki))
    - Questions
        - JG: Do we need all files on disk always? Can we use network mounts? How do we efficiently seed a lot of data?
            - DP: Every [`random-access-storage`](https://github.com/random-access-storage) is supported. But we'd need to stress test/benchmark this.
            - CHJH: If we run these benchmarks I can make some models about estimating 
            - JG: Could talk to Paul Frazee about his experiences too
- Roundabout
  - [Software Sustainability Workshop](https://software.ac.uk/news/call-proposals-mini-workshops-and-demo-sessions-collaborations-workshop-2020) opportunity, do we think we might be able to have a workable Hypergraph by then in one way or the other?
    - JG: Depends a bit on whether we get final designs by February
    - DP: Can do presentation and workshop; presentation could be like preview
