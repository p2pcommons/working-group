# üçê-to-üçê commons working group
[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-1-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors)

The peer-to-peer (üçê-to-üçê) commons is a set of specifications made by humans. In an attempt to make that process transparent, we track the meetings and outcomes of the working group. Meeting notes are separated by meeting into files, following the ISO date format `YYYYMMDD.md`. 

We realize these might not be the easiest to read, because minutes get messy sometime. Also, because the meetings sometimes include talk about other work related to the p2pcommons (e.g., [Hypergraph](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz)), it might be a bit confusing. Any comments or questions are welcome as [an issue](https://github.com/p2pcommons/working-group/issues/new).
