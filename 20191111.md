-   [`@p2pcommons/specs`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs)
    - Hyperdrive `v10` explicitly included in module spec now.
    - [`dat.json` structure proposals](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs/issues/8)
        - What proposal has our preference?
        - proposal 5
        - [weblinks spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/semantics.html#the-link-element) concordance
        - Chris will update the spec and double check with weblinks spec
-   [`@p2pcommons/sdk-js`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js)
    - Update by Diego
        - `0.2.8` -> fix missing `return` statement
        - Chris' comments on `0.3.0` PR
        - When proposal 5 is in spec, will update
        - will make new version `0.2.9` -> use npm version of a package instead of github version
        - only thing blocking 0.3.0 is the spec/module update
        - 0.3.0 end of week, maybe :)
    - Chris asks about key management
        - transport private key into text that you can copy-paste
        - not most secure
        - would like to spend more time with this
        - we could look at flows for PGP keys for example
        - usb keys?
        - developments of hypertrie might be relevant? kappa also used (?)
        - keep an eye on wireline, they might launch some stuff that we can use
        - do we want to stay 100% decentralized and be unusable or introduce a tiny bit of centralization for usage?
-   [`@hypergraph-xyz/cli`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/cli)
    - Update by Julian
        - updated sdk to latest version, thanks Diego for patches :)
        - CI environment is more stable, last two commits good immediately
        - added subtypes based on WikiData identifiers
            - changed prompt to autoselect
        - added autocomplete for bash environments, completes the commands
            - mac and linux (next release)
        - Sped up the tests
            - tests were a bit redundant, now more direct approach using the `sdk-js`
        - Next steps: 
            - Windows CI
            - Open main file function
            - Diego will check tests
    - Wax editor update, by Coko foundation [Chris]
        - There's [`wax-v1`](https://gitlab.coko.foundation/wax/wax) (based on Substance) and [`wax-v2`](https://gitlab.coko.foundation/wax/wax-prosemirror) (based on Prosemirror) --- `wax-v2` has their preference
        - `wax-v2` will be at same stage-ish as `wax-v1` is now in summer 2020, implementable now (see also some [base code](https://gitlab.coko.foundation/wax/wax-prosemirror/blob/master/editors/editoria/src/Editoria.js#L102) and the [`package.json`](https://gitlab.coko.foundation/wax/wax-prosemirror/blob/master/editors/editoria/package.json)
        - Exports to HTML! :) Would make cross-platform consumption straightforward.
        - wax-v2 is modular, so we can build stuff on it that is built for prosemirror
            - Doesn't have citations or math, but has track changes and comments
        - uses react components, so fits in with our pipeline later on for desktop?
        - they'd be down to collaborate, so if we use we have a direct way to make it fit our needs
            - they'd love usage feedback as well for some of their design decisions
        - Julian: Implementing editor will help evaluate editor, put content into modules, and just generally make progress. 
           - lifecycle hooks: custom commands before you publish something?
              ```js
              {
                  "scripts": {
                  "prepublish": "build-markdown-to-html"
                  }
              }
              ```
        - HTML only? Need to think about specs for contents of modules
-   [`@hypergraph-xyz/desktop`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/desktop)
    - Update by Julian
    - Any input for our designer?
        - Julian: Spend some time at the office in December? Would be good
        - Compile list of prior art in this area, other p2p projects
-   `@hypergraph-xyz/mobile`
    - CHJH: I've been thinking about how a mobile application would make for a good authenticator. It depends a bit on the state of multiwriter, but we could have users run a "Hypergraph authenticator" on their mobile, and activate write permissions on their desktop devices by scanning a QR code from their screen. The mobile application would communicate with a `libscie` server that stores their private keys, maybe? It would give a similar UX to Whatsapp desktop. Just a random thought I'd like to discuss, given that key management is a thing we will have to tackle sooner rather than later to prevent lockout.
    - Julian: Just offer it as a service for convenience. Pay for your centralized service without relying on the service? 
        - https://consento.org/blog/funding-ngi-2019/
        - Want to fix people losing their private keys in p2p
        - Might do a call with them to see how that goes? Have sponsored work on Dat desktop previously
    - Diego: After some feedback, decide between features. Maybe costs can be integrated into the registry costs to prevent double-charging?
    - Prior art study about private key management
    - Shouldn't wait to long with this!
