    - Update by Chris
      - Ongoing [pull request for the text specification](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs/pull/17)
        - The text specification separates for text files that are main files and those that aren't
        - Main files
          - MUST be plain HTML (i.e., without javascript and CSS)
          - Minimal DOM that can be automatically injected into elements
            - what does that even mean though? Am I talking out of my neck?
          - All `src` loads must be relative paths
            - This helps ensure the modules are self-contained
          - Some limited JavaScript may be assumed in the working environment?
            - MathJax
            - Some citation library/viewers?
        - Non main files
          - " Non main text files MUST be clear-text files. "
          - Simply to make sure we don't get these blobs in here or .docx
          - Does preclude `pdf` as well, which I can imagine a lot of people want? :woman_shrugging:
        - Open question: Do we want to include this link in the `dat.json` or in the module specification?
          - CHJH: My personal preference would be in the module specification, so we don't have to adjust the `dat.json` any further, but introduces nested specs :woman_shrugging:
