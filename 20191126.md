    - Update by Chris
      - Ongoing [pull request for the text specification](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs/pull/17)
        - The text specification separates for text files that are main files and those that aren't
        - Main files
          - MUST be plain HTML (i.e., without javascript and CSS)
          - Minimal DOM that can be automatically injected into elements
            - what does that even mean though? Am I talking out of my neck?
          - All `src` loads must be relative paths
            - This helps ensure the modules are self-contained
          - Some limited JavaScript may be assumed in the working environment?
            - MathJax
            - Some citation library/viewers?
        - Non main files
          - " Non main text files MUST be clear-text files. "
          - Simply to make sure we don't get these blobs in here or .docx
          - Does preclude `pdf` as well, which I can imagine a lot of people want? :woman_shrugging:
        - Open question: Do we want to include this link in the `dat.json` or in the module specification?
          - CHJH: My personal preference would be in the module specification, so we don't have to adjust the `dat.json` any further, but introduces nested specs :woman_shrugging:. Diego and Julian agreed.
        - Team is going to review in GitHub
    - Questions
-   [`@p2pcommons/sdk-js`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js)
    - Update by Diego
      - Versions `0.3.0` and `0.3.1` were released
      - The `init` method now returns the same signature as other methods, as requested by Julian
      - The errors that can be thrown now have more useful properties attached to them, also as requested by Julian
      - Networking is still a work in progress, we can connect to different `sdk` instances, but can't yet download content
      - On the upside, we're using the checkout function already, which is what our spec is looking for
      - Submitted question https://github.com/andrewosh/corestore-swarm-networking/issues/1, version 1.0 of that module will have more documentation
      - We are extending the aforementioned module, specifically the `handleTopic` method. We don't want it to create multiple swarms for a single store.
      - [there was also a comment about checkouts? DP please add for completeness?]
    - Questions
-   [`@hypergraph-xyz/cli`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/cli)
    - Update by Julian
      - Dogfooding results: Two bugs found. The `open` action didnt' work on mac OS, and the `dat.json` was surprisingly showing a `name` instead of `title`.
     - Started work on editor https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/editor
      - Launches basic wax-prosemirror in browser, edits and saves files
      - Wax devtools are convenient and look very well put together
      - The developers are responsive in the issue tracker, which makes integration easy
      - CHJH will talk to AH of Coko foundation to indicate we're making progress and are starting to get interested for a partnership :handshake:
