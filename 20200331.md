            - JL: Let's plan a product meeting [ACTION]

        - Bump wikidata-identifiers to add new subtype "Procedure"
        - Remove display of module version
        - Create: Add upload info text

-   Product management
    - Update by James
        - Created [`CONTRIBUTING.md` proposal](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/pull/143) for SDK
            - I still need to respond to some comments
            - Up next: CLI, Daemon, Desktop
        - [Glossary proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DxOwBVQrrXNCMWZK4Fgc9-adqgA60jYJrDO4w113MXY/edit) up for all to contribute to. Will need some decisions to be made before it can be published.
        - Made a system for organising test notes
            - Going to see if the document can be shared with everyone
            - In any case these should become part of the process
        - Plan retrospective, mostly for Hypergraph
            - Will put a document online to contribute needs / experiences and suggestions for improvements [ACTION]
        - For now, some small updates to process:
            - New labels for `tech` and `cosmetic` on applicable repos
            - No more "Workflow" checkboxes for now. These three possibilities:
                - `design` -> `code`
                - `code`
                - `task`
            - Review requested on all Hypergraph issues created by me
            - This was already implemented, but not clearly communicated. My apologies!
            - Suggestion: Clear up `Done` column after each dev meeting [ACTION]
        - Want to update `README.md`, esp. for Hypergraph (requested by Chris)
            - JG: Shouldn't this be on the board?
                - JL: Agreed! [ACTION: Create issues for all running tasks + mention in retrospective]
        - Want to update the Bug Report templates following Julian's improvements to the Desktop one
        - Going to (finally) start planning the first external user tests
        - Perhaps @jameslibscie should host the event? [ACTION]
- Roundabout
    - JL: Does everyone have enough to work on?
        - JG: Daemon
        - PSS: Plenty
