    - Wax editor update, by Coko foundation [Chris]
        - There's [`wax-v1`](https://gitlab.coko.foundation/wax/wax) (based on Substance) and [`wax-v2`](https://gitlab.coko.foundation/wax/wax-prosemirror) (based on Prosemirror) --- `wax-v2` has their preference
        - `wax-v2` will be at same stage-ish as `wax-v1` is now in summer 2020, implementable now (see also some [base code](https://gitlab.coko.foundation/wax/wax-prosemirror/blob/master/editors/editoria/src/Editoria.js#L102) and the [`package.json`](https://gitlab.coko.foundation/wax/wax-prosemirror/blob/master/editors/editoria/package.json)
        - Exports to HTML! :) Would make cross-platform consumption straightforward.
        - wax-v2 is modular, so we can build stuff on it that is built for prosemirror
            - Doesn't have citations or math, but has track changes and comments
        - uses react components, so fits in with our pipeline later on for desktop?
        - they'd be down to collaborate, so if we use we have a direct way to make it fit our needs
            - they'd love usage feedback as well for some of their design decisions

    - Any input for our designer?
-   `@hypergraph-xyz/mobile`
    - CHJH: I've been thinking about how a mobile application would make for a good authenticator. It depends a bit on the state of multiwriter, but we could have users run a "Hypergraph authenticator" on their mobile, and activate write permissions on their desktop devices by scanning a QR code from their screen. The mobile application would communicate with a `libscie` server that stores their private keys, maybe? It would give a similar UX to Whatsapp desktop. Just a random thought I'd like to discuss, given that key management is a thing we will have to tackle sooner rather than later to prevent lockout.
