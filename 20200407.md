-   Highlights
    - Working on new development process for Hypergraph
    - Continued Daemon research
-   About this meeting
    - Last week we questioned whether the current meeting format is effective
    - What do people currently get out of this meeting?
        - CH: Some overlap with standup, but that is not as in-depth
        - CH: Meeting notes acts as documentation of our process (not a must)
        - CH: Demos
        - CH: Talk with the whole team
        - DP: This acted like a stand-up, there is some overlap
        - DP: See your faces and connect
        - DP: Frequency is good
        - DP: Perhaps take the time to explore a topic deeper?
        - DP: Moment for feedback
        - JG: Talk to Diego - as this is the only face time we have
        - JG: Technical discussion, but we'd be better off not saving discussion for the weekly meeting
        - JG: How about a weekly office hour (for technical / work chat)?
        - PSS: Agree with the above
        - PSS: Technical aspect is not so important for me
        - PSS: Book-ending the day with meetings is difficult
        - PSS: Face time is nice, I'd like a weekly office hour
        - CH: The idea was to have a working group for the p2pcommons. Who is in that group and when do we need to meet?
        - CH: We could do the updates asynchronously and combine that with an office hour
        - JL: Progress from week-to-week
        - JL: Discussion arises naturally
    - Proposals:
        - CH: Split out p2pcommons working group formally, to be hosted as needed (by CH), and change time slot to 16:00-17:00 on a voice channel (that also supports video). Informal chat format with room for technical questions.
        - JL: Will personally plan a moment for a weekly review
-   General announcements
    - Updated order so Patch doesn't have to join for the whole meeting (JL forgot to actually mention this)
-   [`@hypergraph-xyz/desktop`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/desktop)
    - Q / JL: Merge the [expand parent](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/desktop/pull/51) PR now?
        - Yes
    - Q / JL: Close the [Shorten file names](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/desktop/issues/56) issue?
        - Yes
-   [`@p2pcommons/specs`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs)
    - Update by James
        - No progress on [whitespace](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs/issues/28), [text spec](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs/pull/17) or [draft parents](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs/issues/27) issues
            - CH: Deal with whitespace on Hypergraph level?
                - JG: That does complicate things from a design point of view
                    - CH: Then we can say that whitespace-only titles are not allowed [ACTION: JL]
            - CH: Text specs needs figuring out
            - CH: Need to take a look at parents
        - Terminology meeting planned regarding use of `Dat archive` and `publish`
    - Q / CH: Who wants to be a part of the working group?
        - Chris, Diego, Julian & James as voting members - Patch as advisory member
        - CH manages process for this
-   [`@p2pcommons/sdk-js`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js)
    - Update by Diego
        - Continue with the integration between hyperdrive-daemon and our SDK. Have to launch a daemon instance from the sdk and then the client, also adjusting some values returned from the new remote hyperdrive. Seems to be working, at least for some basic tests, but I need to improve the startup setup (daemon launch) because tests are hanging (they doesn't end)
        - Also did some repo maintenance work, merging some PR and preparing others.
        - Thanks to James & Julian now we have merged a good looking contributing doc.
        - Going to continue with integration work these days and prepare a new release soon with some open PRs.
    - JL: Julian suggested [standard linter](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/issues/151). Should we add that?
        - DP: Yes
-   Product management
    - Update by James
        - Hosted Hypergraph Retrospective. Results will be documented and shared very soon for a final round of feedback
        - Set up `CONTRIBUTING.md` proposal for `sdk-js`, will do so soon for other products
        - Updated `README.md` for `cli` and Desktop
        - User testing invitation is now ready to send out
