    - Update by Patch
        - Creating a new system for tracking designs in Figma.
        - A system for referencing current designs and a place for future work.
    - Update by Julian
        - Create `@hypergraph-xyz/wikidata-identifiers` module, in order to share content types between Desktop and CLI
        - Implement Menu, Header, View profile, Welcome modals (and a lot of tiny things)
    - Update by James
        - Spoke with Julian about scope for `v0.1.0`
        - We will keep working according to the roadmap / existing issues and to leave new (usability) issues that arise for the next iteration
        - This should give us a product that is probably not great in actual use, but does exactly what is necessary for an early demo and feedback
        - Some changes in process:
            - Issues should spec what is design-only (as the designs may run ahead)
            - In GitHub we're skipping the clickthrough step for current issues
            - Results from clickthroughs and other user testing will result in new issues, rather than scope change on existing issues
        - Re-spec'd some issues:
            - Home -> Workspace
            - Workspace is new default page after the welcome modals
