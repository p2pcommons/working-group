    - Update by James
        - Discussions regarding uniqueness and self-referencing
            - `follows` must not self-reference
            - `parents` must not self-reference the current version
            - `authors`, `parents`, `follows` and `contents` must not contain duplicates
            - `follows`, `contents` and `parents` may still reference multiple versions of the same module (no change)

    - Questions
        - James: Let's say someone publishes version 10 of a content module to their profile. Later new versions are created.
        Can someone access those versions by just upping the version number in the link? Or are only `valid` / verified modules seeded?
            - Answer: Not sure, [ACTION] @jameslibscie adds to networking scenario document
