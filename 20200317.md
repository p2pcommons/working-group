-   General announcements
-   [`@p2pcommons/specs`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs)
    - Update by James
        - Discussion surrounding uniqueness wording still ongoing (`0.2.4`)
    - Update by Chris
        - Food for thought: Ambiguity in terminology - Dat archive vs Hyperdrive vs Hypercore. Suggestion to replace Dat archive with Hyperdrive in specs. URL prefix also uses dat:// [ACTION: @jameslibscie creates issue]
        - Q / James: Do we have control over the prefix? Thinking about opening links in external application.
             - Yes, but it's not necessary for opening a link in an external application.
-   [`@p2pcommons/sdk-js`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js)
    - Update by Diego
        - Put some work on sdk issues, the result were 2 new releases: `0.5.4`, `0.5.5`
        - Updated to module's spec `0.2.3`
        - Add avatar support
        - Checks for main file existing upon `validate()`
        - Improved consistency of `clone` method output
        - Replace `parse-dat-url` with `url-parse`
        - Currently doing some research around integrating with the hyperdrive-daemon (initial steps)
        - Q / Julian: Issues with Fuse on Windows - how urgent are these?
            - Fuse on Windows means that files won't be shown in OS. Whether we want to implement this also depends on the workflow we want to use for updating modules.
    - Update by James
        - Created issues for SDK `0.6` - Daemon + events for notifying implementations of new versions of Hyperdrives
