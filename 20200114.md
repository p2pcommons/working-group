      - Some new issues with the core of hyperdrive, where hyperdrives cannot be opened. Seems to be a regression and collection of issues. We will need to coordinate with Hyperdivision about this (see [issue 1](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/issues/57), [issue 2](https://github.com/geut/hyperdrive-promise/pull/10), [issue 3](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdrive/issues/260), [issue 4](https://github.com/geut/hyperdrive-promise/pull/10/commits/98e3b76c26acc1de40625c2dfc87584199a8ba4d#diff-e2686e2925145c11799d638b2f4706dcR207)); already talking to Andrew.
