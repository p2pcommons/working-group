-   Highlights
    - Done:
        - Adding content on Desktop + lots of small cosmetic improvements
        - Option to delete local files when deleting a module in SDK
    - In progress:
        - Making multiple designs for creating and browsing follow-up content and selecting which content is the `parent` content
        - Specs discussions regarding whether parent modules need to be published first and which file formats should be allowed
        - Research for the Daemon
        - Glossary for Hypergraph and/or Liberate Science
    - Up next:
        - Input validation and error handling on Desktop
        - Exploratory work on Daemon app
-   [`@p2pcommons/specs`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs)
    - [Discussion surrounding uniqueness wording still ongoing (`0.2.4`)](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs/pull/25)
    - Discussion: Should a parent module have to be published first?
        - JL / Suggestion: Parent has to be published before publishing
            - CH / Unpublished content also needs to be referable
            - CH / Selecting a draft at earlier version -> probably want to refer to a later version if work continues
            - CH / Publishing isn't definitive in the sense that work does not have to be completed when it's published
            - JG / The term `publish` might be confusing here as it seems more definitive
            - CH will make proposals
    - Discussion: What file formats should be allowed as a main file?
        - CH / Suggestion: Open file formats as good first step - then add limitations for text based files later? How open is a module that has a main file which can only be opened using paid software? (see also [List of open formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open_formats))
            - JG: What does this require from a user in order to read files?
                - CH: Install free / open source software
            - JG / Suggestion: Allow open file formats, but recommend specific file formats

    - Update by Diego
        - Fix clone method output
        - Added deleteFiles option to delete method [ACTION@JL: Create CLI issue & Desktop roadmap]
        - Released sdk v0.5.6
        - Working on getting offline data modifications on ready, i.e.: files can be changed when the sdk is not working, it is interesting to "import" those changes on `ready`. This is related to #138.

            - JL: Why does the version show as v3?
                - JG+CH: Should we even show the version number?
                    - Let's drop it for now
            - PSS: I might want to rearrange the module list if we're rethinking the metadata?
            - CH: Should the Workspace contain published work?
                - Needs further discussion

    - New Hyperdrive Daemon app repository
        - JL: Where should the issues live?
            - JG: Initially, these will need to be created in the Daemon repo and later also on Desktop. These won't share code, but a lot can be copy/pasted between projects
