    - Update by Julian
      - API part started; set up basic webserver and basic Stripe webhook endpoint
      - Set up Dockerfile and deploy script; have deployed but not reachable
      - When we decide to move away from AWS, we can move eg to Google Cloudrun, or self-hosted environment.
      - Serverless: We would be deploying application code, and not server operations. Problem for us is that it isn't portable. We could use serverless docker, which doesn't have this issue. We wouldn't need to manage the machines. Serverless abstracts the machine away
      - If we want to manage our own machines we'd need an ops person.
      - This would be a good moment to see how distributed filesystems (for DP). E.g., an s3 worker.

    - CHJH: Will start looking for an operations director sometime soon, to free up time for community building.
