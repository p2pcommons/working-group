      - Finishing the migration to latest hyperdrive and corestore version.
      - Gtting some help from Andrew (hyper division). Q&A.
      - Planning to wrap up and release a new version of the sdk, v0.4.0 on Friday (24/01)
      - Added settings.json support. See [PR](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/pull/65)
      - Looking into restoring previously created hyperdrives. If the user re-opens the app we need to be able to read the old drives again, not only the modules.
      - Restore drives from leveldb ?
      - Also need to remove the keyPair option from the hyperdrive creation and rely only on namespaces.
      - Created a small example where I can test/play with this before moving to the sdk.

      - Creating a clickthrough from the flow and features James and I created.
      - Will be finished and shared internally this week.
      - Should be shown to 1-2 outside testers after several quick internal iterations.
      - We need to discuss and formulate a plan/script for testing with people who are not immediately familiar with our project and product

        - Put together feature list for MVP with Chris & Patch. Basic [Roadmap](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/desktop/wiki/Roadmap) now live on the [Hypergraph Desktop wiki](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/desktop/wiki)
        - Planning 1-on-1s with the people I haven't met IRL yet to discuss how we can work together most effectively
        - Next steps:
          - Convert feature list to issues and create GitHub Projects (or similar) board(s) for managing the work
          - Identify SDK, CLI and non-technical issues for work that needs doing prior to these identified Desktop issues
