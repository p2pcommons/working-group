    - Update by Diego
        - Finishing the migration to latest hyperdrive and corestore version.
        - Gtting some help from Andrew (hyper division). Q&A.
        - Planning to wrap up and release a new version of the sdk, v0.4.0 on Friday (24/01)
        - Added settings.json support. See [PR](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/pull/65)
        - Looking into restoring previously created hyperdrives. If the user re-opens the app we need to be able to read the old drives again, not only the modules.
        - Restore drives from leveldb ?
        - Also need to remove the keyPair option from the hyperdrive creation and rely only on namespaces.
        - Created a small example where I can test/play with this before moving to the sdk.
    - Questions
        - James: Does the SDK distinguish between different ways of editing metadata in any way? Or is it just a json overwrite of the metadata that gets validated? Walk through roadmap feature list...

        - Updating to SDK 0.4.0 is a WIP, Diego is debugging an issue
    - Questions
        - James: can we currently select a parent module for a content module? Couldn't find that feature...
        - James: To what extent do we need / would we like to have CLI implementations *before* desktop implementations?

    - Update by Patch
        - Creating a clickthrough from the flow and features James and I created.
        - Will be finished and shared internally this week.
        - Should be shown to 1-2 outside testers after several quick internal iterations.
        - We need to discuss and formulate a plan/script for testing with people who are not immediately familiar with our project and product

-   [`@hypergraph-xyz/vault`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/vault)
    - Update by Julian
        - Removed all mentions of the domain, as legalities need to be figured out still
        - Create basic API in preparation for the Worker
        - Create basic Worker that will fetch modules from the Vault's API and replicate them (currently without any backend like s3)
        - WIP: Deploying the worker to AWS, need to read up on more AWS resources. If this takes too long we might seek a contractor for the initial setup.

    - Update by James
        - Put together feature list for MVP with Chris & Patch. Basic [Roadmap](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/desktop/wiki/Roadmap) now live on the [Hypergraph Desktop wiki](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/desktop/wiki)
            - Scoped in: Ephemeral project management tool for solo projects
            - Scoped out: Vault, all sharing (networking) and collaboration
        - Planning 1-on-1s with the people I haven't met IRL yet to discuss how we can work together most effectively
        - Next steps:
            - Convert feature list to issues and create GitHub Projects (or similar) board(s) for managing the work
            - Identify SDK, CLI and non-technical issues for work that needs doing prior to these identified Desktop issues
