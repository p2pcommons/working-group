-   Highlights
    - Done:
        - Coding work on [`@hypergraph-xyz/desktop`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/desktop) started
        - [`@p2pcommons/specs`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs) updates regarding uniqueness and self-referencing
        - `follow` and `unfollow` actions for [`@hypergraph-xyz/cli`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/cli)
        - [Hypergraph Desktop roadmap](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/desktop/wiki/Roadmap) expanded with networking features
    - In progress:
        - Module verification in [`@p2pcommons/sdk-js`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js) (see also [specs](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs/blob/master/module.md#verification))
        - Welcome modal design for [`@hypergraph-xyz/desktop`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/desktop)
        - First internal clickthroughs of [`@hypergraph-xyz/desktop`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/desktop) mockups
    - To do coming week:
        - Further hand-off and implementation of [`@hypergraph-xyz/desktop`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/desktop) designs
        - Connecting [`@hypergraph-xyz/desktop`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/desktop) to the `sdk` to see real data in-app (created by the `cli`)
        - Implementing `specs` updates in [`@p2pcommons/sdk-js`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js)
-   [`@p2pcommons/specs`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs)
    - Update by James
        - Specs 0.2.3
            - `follows` must not self-reference
            - `parents` must not self-reference the current version
            - `authors`, `parents`, `follows` and `contents` must not contain duplicate strings
    - Questions
        - Julian: Would "unique URL" not be better than "unique string"?
            - James: "Unique string" actually doesn't even work properly, since "dat://12345+6" and "12345+6" are different strings, but refer to the same versioned key. We need clear terminology for this. [ACTION: Update specs and start discussion re: terminology]
-   [`@p2pcommons/sdk-js`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js)
    - Update by Diego
        - Minor improvements on tests to make windows travis behaviour more predictable
        - Added a changelog to the project
        - Make ready method implicit
        - Throw validation error with extra parameters (schema check)
        - Using npm for releases (npm version && npm publish)
        - New release: 0.5.2
        - Working on: verify method and updating to module spec 0.2.3
    - Questions
        - James & Julian: What is the purpose of verification on publish? When does it happen and what is it for?
            - Answer: There isn't much point in verifying modules before publication, as they would be unverified before first publish. Verifying after publishing is an option, but this seems like more of a UX thing, which the implementation should handle. The SDK can check whether the modules are writable and could also check whether it is expected that `publish` will result in verified modules. [ACTION: Add discussion to pull request]
        - Diego: What about set()? There are currently multiple ways to edit metadata that work in different ways. And control of dat.json?
            - Answer: It makes sense for there to be a direct method for writing metadata. This metadata should be validated in the future.
