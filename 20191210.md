-   General announcements
    -   Roadmaps are now available under the Wiki of each respective repository!
    -   We're loosening the business plan specification of version alignment between cli and desktop to be able to follow `semver` better down the line.
-   [`@p2pcommons/specs`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/specs)
    - Update by Chris
      - Will add a `title` length limit soon
        - This will be informed by the distribution of character lengths of titles in the CrossRef API. CHJH will inspect this in the next week and make a PR summarising the data.
    - Questions
      CHJH: If we're limiting `title`, do we want to limit `description`?
        - DP: Maybe using abstract length?
          - CHJH: Not well indexed in CrossRef (e.g., .002% for likes of Elsevier)
        - JG: Preferably not.
        - *discussion goes towards `leveldb` limitations, JG finds out there are none
-   [`@p2pcommons/sdk-js`](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js)
    - Update by Diego
      - Merged PR integrating some basic networking updates, and some minor fixes (e.g., [for checkout of versioned Dat archives](https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/issues/48))
      - Worked on further testing the checkout functionality and the versioned registration of content to the profile. This resulted in some further debugging due to some versions bringing in data and others not. 
      - More debugging led to the question whether this is an issue in our codebase or `hyperdrive`'s --- everything worked fine in `hyperdrive` and `hyperpromise` so it's in our codebase. PR follows soon with the fix
      - Talked to Andrew (Hyperdivision) and apparently the Hyperdrive is updating again soon with another change that breaks backward compatibility
        - CHJH: Before we can move to production we'd probably need to talk to Hyperdivision about the stability of the protocol moving forward
    - Questions
      - CHJH: Does this unblock JG's [`v0.3.0` PR for the CLI](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/cli/pull/56)?
        - DP: Yes.
-   [`@hypergraph-xyz/cli`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/cli)
    - Update by Julian
      - [Added back the `read` functionality](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/cli/commit/68a167cde80fd5222a88116d03336d409828fe53) but no longer JSON, now nicely formatted (inspired by academic paper headers).
      - Decided to limit CLI to one profile, and autolink content modules to that profile
        - Will streamline the content creation if no profile present (now exits, but can simply prompt to create a profile).
      - Biggest change: [Integrated the editor](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/cli/commit/3ed64f1e04ecf689d1954b18844873c458c789ba)
    - Questions
      - CHJH: Is it possible to merge the now unblocked PR before Christmas?
        - JG: Yes.
