    - Questions
        - James: self-referencing profiles?
            - It doesn't make sense for profiles to follow themselves. The specs should be updated (@jameslibscie will do this) and issues for SDK, CLI will follow
        - James: should the main file be html?
            - We don't need to enforce this, it will likely emerge as the preferred format if we support html better than other formats

    - Update by Julian
        - Add update `.parents` in `update` action -> `.parents` support should be complete
        - Add log in and publishing to `Vault` on `publish`
        - Prevent publishing already published modules (at already published version)
        - Add `logout` action
        - Refactor console output to be more consistent
    - Questions
        - James: What about releases? Are they blocked by unclosed issues? How do I install a specific build?
            - Currently no need for releases. Builds can be installed and tested by cloning the repo and running `npm install` `npm link` from there
        - James: Do the specs include anything regarding publishing already published modules?
            - No, but they should. Uniqueness is missing in several places. @jameslibscie will do this, issues for SDK will follow

    - Questions
        - Julian: What about internal testing? We should use the Figma clickthrough with the built-in comment feature
            - We can start on that immediately, also to get feedback on the text
-   [`@hypergraph-xyz/vault`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/vault)

-   Product management
    - Update by James
        - Spoke with Chris about Hypergraph being science-specific vs general purpose. Strategy for the time being is to push Hypergraph as a science-specific tool
