    - Update by Diego
        - Released sdk 0.4.1
        - Added a test case using child_process to simulate multiple sdk instances, creating content and re-open it.
        - Worked on travis windows test (there were issues with the child_process). There is no debug mode for windows yet.
        - Releases: 0.4.2 and just recently 0.4.3. Last one includes some fixes related to some new dependencies changes (hyperdrive-schemas)
        - Started to work on sdk v0.5.0 (delete method, clone, follow) https://github.com/p2pcommons/sdk-js/pull/69 (@jameslibscie creates issue for follow)
    - Questions
        - Delete vs unpublish
            - Delete removes from local DB
            - Unpublish would search for profiles that reference the content module and update the content + all those profiles
            - Unpublish also needs to take into account which content may or may not be writable
            - "Deauthoring" of content we don't own can be postponed till later (@jameslibscie will create new issues)
        - Validating metadata - quite easy to corrupt the metadata
            - @chartgerink will create issue
-   [`@hypergraph-xyz/cli`](https://github.com/hypergraph-xyz/cli)
    - Update by Julian
        - Upgrade sdk to 0.4.3
        - Abort early if trying to create a profile although one already exists
        - Release 0.3.1

    - Update by Patch
        - Spoke with Neha and James about testing
        - Continued work on the prototypes, link will be sent out with the next newsletter (by @chartgerink)
        - Going to prioritise the clickthrough for internal/external testing, then work on fine tuning for development reference and accessibility and the websites
        - Showcasing my work thus far
    - Update by Julian
        - Add release script for 1-command publishing a new version
        - Finish build infrastructure
    - Questions
        - Will the website and desktop app design have similarities?
            - 16x16 basis will be shared
            - Potentially less "grid"
            - Try to have it as similar as possible / makes sense
        - Certificates for installers?
            - Windows and mac need certificates! (@jameslibscie will create issues)

        - Building up a project board & backlog for the Desktop MVP
            - Added most of the issues for the first MVP version
            - Created status labels - still needs refining a little
            - [project-bot](https://github.com/philschatz/project-bot) moves issues between columns based on status
            - After the first block of MVP issues, I'll finish the status labels and write guidelines
        - Clickthrough testing
            - Done first exploration and set main learning goals
            - Once first clickthrough is ready, we will meet again to create a script for the clickthrough
- Roundabout
    - We had an outside contribution! [Thanks @GabrielBB](https://github.com/GabrielBB)
